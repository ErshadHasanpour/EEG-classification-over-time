# EEG classification over time with temporal fetures
## Dataset
In this project we have an EEG dataset which contains signals from 126 electrodes(channels) for two tasks, seeing human face and piano pictures. the dataset has 3 dimension, num_trials*num_channels*time(90*126*3500).The sampling frequency is 500Hz,which result in 7 seconds records for each trial. The dataset for both tasks are seperated and in *.mat* format.
